    header: "What is a digital loan and how does it work?",
    content:
      "A digital loan is a financial product offered through an online platform, allowing users to apply for, receive, and repay loans entirely digitally. The process begins with account creation and identity verification, followed by submission of financial information. Once a loan request is evaluated, users can receive approval and access a digital loan agreement. Funds are disbursed through secure channels, and repayment is tracked within the platform. Digital loans streamline the traditional lending process, making it faster, more transparent, and accessible from anywhere."

      "Eligibility depends on factors such as verified identity, income level, repayment capacity, and existing financial obligations. Users must complete the KYC verification process and provide accurate financial details. The platform assesses the requested loan amount relative to income and existing commitments to determine whether the user qualifies. Users who meet the criteria can proceed with the loan application, while those who do not may be advised to improve eligibility for future applications."
