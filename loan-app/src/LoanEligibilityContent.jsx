    header: "General Eligibility Overview",
    content:
      "Loan eligibility determines whether a user qualifies to apply for and receive a loan through the platform. The eligibility process is designed to be transparent, fair, and easy to understand. By evaluating basic personal and financial criteria, the platform ensures that loans are offered responsibly and in a manner that supports both borrower sustainability and platform risk management. Meeting eligibility requirements does not guarantee loan approval but allows users to proceed with a loan application."
  },
  {
    header: "Verified Identity Requirement",
    content:
      "All users must successfully complete identity verification before being considered eligible for a loan. This includes providing accurate personal information and completing the required Know Your Customer (KYC) checks. Identity verification helps protect the platform against fraud, ensures compliance with regulatory standards, and establishes trust between borrowers and the system. Applications from users with incomplete or failed verification will not be eligible for loan consideration."
  },
  {
    header: "Minimum Income Assessment",
    content:
      "Eligibility is assessed based on the user’s declared income level. The platform evaluates whether the reported income is sufficient to support loan repayment without causing financial distress. This assessment helps promote responsible lending by ensuring borrowers are not approved for loan amounts that exceed their repayment capacity. Income information must be truthful and may be subject to verification or consistency checks."
  },
  {
    header: "Loan Amount to Income Ratio",
    content:
      "One of the key eligibility criteria is the relationship between the requested loan amount and the user’s income. The platform applies predefined thresholds to determine whether the requested loan is reasonable relative to the borrower’s earnings. Requests that significantly exceed acceptable ratios may be declined or marked as pending for further review. This approach reduces default risk and promotes long-term financial stability for borrowers."
  },
  {
    header: "Existing Financial Obligations",
    content:
      "Users are required to disclose existing financial commitments that may impact their ability to repay a new loan. These obligations are considered during eligibility assessment to ensure users are not overburdened with debt. High existing obligations may reduce eligibility or limit the maximum loan amount available. The goal is to prevent excessive borrowing and encourage responsible financial behavior."
  },
  {
    header: "Employment or Income Stability",
    content:
      "Eligibility takes into account the stability and reliability of the user’s income source. Users with consistent income streams are more likely to meet eligibility requirements than those with irregular or uncertain earnings. This assessment helps the platform determine the likelihood of timely repayment and reduces exposure to repayment risks."
  },
  {
    header: "Application Completeness and Accuracy",
    content:
      "To be eligible, users must submit complete and accurate information throughout the application process. Incomplete forms, inconsistent data, or false declarations may result in ineligibility or application rejection. This requirement ensures that eligibility decisions are based on reliable data and that the evaluation process remains fair for all users."
  },
  {
    header: "Eligibility Outcomes",
    content:
      "Based on the evaluation of all eligibility criteria, users receive one of three outcomes. An eligible status allows the user to proceed with loan approval and agreement review. A pending status indicates that additional information or review is required. An ineligible status means the user does not meet current eligibility requirements and cannot proceed with the loan at this time. Clear feedback is provided to help users understand the outcome."
  },
  {
    header: "Ongoing Eligibility Review",
    content:
      "Eligibility may be reassessed over time based on user behavior, repayment history, and updated information. Responsible borrowing and timely repayments may improve future eligibility, while missed payments or inaccurate data may reduce access to loan services. This ongoing review encourages positive financial behavior and helps maintain a healthy lending ecosystem."
